     * @brief Factory responsible for resolving audio decoders.
     *
     * DecoderRegistry provides a centralized mechanism for locating an
     * appropriate AAudioDecoder implementation for a given audio file or
     * decoder type.
     *
     * The registry abstracts format-specific decoder selection from the rest
     * of the audio subsystem, allowing clients to decode audio files without
     * needing to know which concrete decoder implementation is required.
     *
     * Supported decoder implementations are evaluated sequentially until a
     * compatible decoder is found.
     *
     * @note The current implementation uses a static collection of decoder
     * instances.
     *
     * @note Future implementations may replace the linear search with a more
     * efficient lookup mechanism or a plugin-based architecture.
