     * The Primitive class serves as a base class for simple geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, and planes. It provides a common interface and properties for these shapes, allowing for consistent handling and rendering within the graphics application. The Primitive class can be extended to create specific types of primitives with additional properties and behaviors as needed.
