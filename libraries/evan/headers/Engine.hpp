	 * @brief The Engine class is the main entry point for the Evan Engine. It
	 * manages the core components of the engine, including the device context,
	 * renderer, scenes, swapchain context, and platform abstraction. The
	 * Engine class is responsible for initializing these components, running
	 * the main loop of the engine, and providing methods for updating and
	 * rendering scenes. It serves as the central hub for managing the engine's
	 * functionality and orchestrating the various subsystems to create a
	 * cohesive experience.
	 *
	 * The Engine class provides a high-level interface for interacting with
	 * the engine, allowing users to add scenes, handle updates, and manage
	 * rendering without needing to directly interact with the lower-level
	 * components. It abstracts away the complexities of Vulkan and
	 * platform-specific details, providing a more user-friendly API for
	 * developers using the Evan Engine.
	 *
	 * The Engine class is designed to be extensible and modular, allowing for
	 * future enhancements and additions to the engine's capabilities. It can be
	 * extended to support additional features such as physics, audio, or
	 * networking, while still maintaining a clear separation of concerns
	 * between different subsystems of the engine.
	 *
	 * Overall, the Engine class serves as the backbone of the Evan Engine,
	 * providing a structured and organized way to manage the various components
	 * and functionalities of the engine while offering a user-friendly
	 * interface for developers to create their applications.
	 *
	 * @note The Engine class is currently in its early stages of development,
	 * and additional features and improvements are expected to be added in
	 * future iterations of the engine. The current implementation focuses on
	 * establishing the core structure and functionality of the engine, with
	 * plans for further enhancements and optimizations in the future.
