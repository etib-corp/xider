     * hand tracking actions, including creating action sets, defining hand
     * poses, and handling input from hand tracking devices. It provides an
     * interface for integrating hand tracking capabilities into an OpenXR
     * application, allowing developers to create immersive experiences that
     * utilize hand gestures and movements.
