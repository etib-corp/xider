	 * @class XrSwapchainImage
	 *
	 * @brief Represents a swapchain image for OpenXR rendering.
	 *
	 * This class encapsulates the functionality for managing swapchain images
	 * in the context of OpenXR rendering. It inherits from ASwapchainImage and
	 * provides implementations for destroying the swapchain images and filling
	 * presentation information. The class holds a reference to the OpenXR
	 * swapchain handle, the dimensions of the swapchain images, and a vector of
	 * Vulkan swapchain image structures. It also includes a structure for
	 * encapsulating properties required for creating an instance of
	 * XrSwapchainImage, which includes the OpenXR swapchain handle, swapchain
	 * creation info, Vulkan render pass, and a reference to the device context.
	 *
	 * @note The XrSwapchainImage class is designed to work within the rendering
	 * system of the project, providing a way to manage swapchain images for
	 * OpenXR applications. It is responsible for handling the lifecycle of the
	 * swapchain images, including their creation, destruction, and presentation
	 * to the screen.
