	 * @brief The XrSwapchainContext class manages the swapchain context for an
	 * OpenXR application using Vulkan. It inherits from ASwapchainContext and
	 * provides implementations for acquiring images from the swapchain, waiting
	 * for images to be available, and updating projection layer views based on
	 * the current view configurations. The class also maintains a vector of
	 * XrCompositionLayerProjectionView structures that represent the projection
	 * layer views for each view configuration, allowing for efficient
	 * management of rendering resources in a VR application.
	 *
	 * @note The XrSwapchainContext class is designed to work with the
	 * DeviceContext class to manage Vulkan resources and ensure proper
	 * synchronization when acquiring images from the swapchain. It also
	 * provides methods to retrieve projection and view matrices for rendering
	 * operations, making it an essential component of the rendering system in
	 * an OpenXR application.
