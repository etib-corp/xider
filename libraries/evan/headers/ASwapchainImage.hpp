	 * swapchain of the Evan engine. It serves as a base class for specific
	 * implementations of swapchain images that are compatible with different
	 * graphics APIs (e.g., DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL). The ASwapchainImage class
	 * provides an interface for managing the properties and behavior of
	 * swapchain images, which are used to present rendered content to the
	 * screen.
	 *
	 * @note The ASwapchainImage class is designed to be inherited by specific
	 * implementations for different graphics APIs. It defines the necessary
	 * functions and properties that must be implemented by derived classes to
	 * ensure proper functionality of swapchain images within the Evan engine's
	 * rendering system.
