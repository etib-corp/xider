	 * Vulkan rendering operations.
	 *
	 * The GPUMaterial class is responsible for managing the Vulkan resources
	 * associated with a material, including creating images from texture files,
	 * generating mipmaps, creating image views and samplers, and setting up
	 * descriptor sets for shader access. It provides methods for initializing
	 * these resources based on a given texture path and the device context and
	 * renderer instances. The class also includes functionality for cleaning up
	 * Vulkan resources when they are no longer needed.

		 * used to initialize the Vulkan resources for this material.
		 * @param shaderID The unique ID of the shader associated with this material, used to identify which shader program should be used when rendering objects that utilize this material.
