	 * @brief A swapchain image implementation for desktop platforms using GLFW.
	 *
	 * This class manages the creation and presentation of swapchain images for
	 * a GLFW window. It handles the selection of surface formats, present
	 * modes, and swap extents based on the capabilities of the physical device
	 * and the window properties.
	 *
	 * The DesktopSwapchainImage class inherits from ASwapchainImage and
	 * implements the necessary functionality to create and manage a Vulkan
	 * swapchain for a desktop application. It provides methods to destroy the
	 * swapchain and fill presentation information for presenting images to the
	 * screen.

		 * This constructor initializes the swapchain image by creating a Vulkan
		 * swapchain based on the provided device context, GLFW window, and
		 * render pass. It selects appropriate surface formats, present modes,
		 * and swap extents to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with
		 * the rendering pipeline.
		 *
		 * @param deviceContext The device context containing the Vulkan device
		 * and related resources needed for swapchain creation.
		 * @param window The GLFW window for which the swapchain image is being
		 * created. The window properties are used to determine the swap extent
		 * and other parameters for the swapchain.
		 * @param renderpass The Vulkan render pass that will be used with the
		 * swapchain images during rendering operations. The render pass defines
		 * the attachments and subpasses that will be used when rendering to the
		 * swapchain images.
		 *
		 * @note The constructor performs several steps to create the swapchain,
		 * including:
		 * - Querying the physical device for swapchain support details.
		 * - Choosing appropriate surface formats, present modes, and swap
		 * extents based on the capabilities of the physical device and the
		 * properties of the GLFW window.
		 * - Creating the Vulkan swapchain and associated image views for
		 * rendering.
		 * - Storing the swapchain handle for later use in presentation and
		 * cleanup operations.
